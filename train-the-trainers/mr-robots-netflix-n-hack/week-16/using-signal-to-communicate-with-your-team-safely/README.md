# Scenario

> :construction: TK-TODO

# Prerequisites

To participate in this exercise, you must have:

* A friend! :) (You can also do this exercise yourself by role-playing both the sender and receiver portions, but everything is more fun with friends.)
* A smartphone running a recent version of the Android or Apple iOS operating systems such as a Google Pixel, Samsung Galaxy, or Apple iPhone.
* An active Internet connection.

Although not technically required, this exercise is a lot easier if you also have:

* A phone number capable of receiving SMS messages (plain old text messages).
* A computer running any modern version of:
    * Windows,
    * macOS, or
    * any flavor of the GNU/Linux operating system.

# Set up

In addition to your phone, laptop, or desktop computer and an active Internet connection, you will need to acquire the Signal software itself.

* [Signal.org](https://Signal.org/), the Signal Private Messenger homepage, links to installation options for all supported devices.
    * Android users who cannot use the official Google Play Store for some reason (perhaps you do not have a Google Account), you may also install Signal directly by [downloading the Signal app's Android package file (`.apk`)](https://signal.org/android/apk/) from the Signal website.

Follow the above links. Then download and install the appropriate software package for your operating system. The installation process should be familiar, since it is performed in the same way as for any other software application that runs on your operating system.
