# Recognizing fake websites and phishing scams

In this exercise we will create a fake version of a popular website's login page (a *[phishing](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phishing) site*) in order to trick an unsuspecting user into giving us their username and password combination for that website. We will then be able to impersonate that user to the website, gaining access to their account. Our goal is to more quickly recognize the signs of a malicious website so that we sensitize ourselves to any red flags or warnings we experience while browsing the Web.

# Objectives

When you complete this exercise, you will have acquired the following capabilities:

* The ability to preview where clicking a link will take you before you visit the link.
* The ability to verify the identity of the owner of a Web site by examining its security certificate in your Web browser.
* The ability to more reliably recognize differences between legitimate communications and scams.
* The ability to utilize the [Social Engineer's Toolkit](https://www.trustedsec.com/social-engineer-toolkit-set/) to launch a rudimentary phishing attack.

# Scenario

[![Clip from "Mr. Robot" Season 1, Episode 3, where Elliot phishes his neighbor, Shayla.](https://web.archive.org/web/20170317233813/https://i.imgur.com/5js8hxe.jpg)](Mr.%20Robot%20S01E03%20-%20Simple%20Phishing%20Scam.mp4?raw=true)

> Of course I know Shayla. I hacked her email as soon as she moved in next door. With a simple phishing scam I owned her password pretty easily.

# Prerequisites

To participate in this exercise, you must have:

* A computer running any modern version of:
    * Windows,
    * macOS,
    * FreeBSD,
    * Solaris,
    * any flavor of the GNU/Linux operating system.
* An active Internet connection.

> :beginner: :computer: This exercise requires the use of a command line, or "terminal." If you don't know what that means, or if you do but you feel intimidated by that, consider going through [Tech Learning Collective&rsquo;s free, online and self-paced *Foundations: Command Line Basics* course](https://techlearningcollective.com/foundations/), spending an hour at [Apple's Terminal User Guide](https://support.apple.com/guide/terminal/) (for macOS users), [Ubuntu's Command Line for Beginners tutorial](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/command-line-for-beginners) (for GNU/Linux users) or reviewing [Computer Hope's article, "How to use the Windows command line (DOS)"](http://www.computerhope.com/issues/chusedos.htm) (for Windows users) if you want to get started quickly. You don't need to complete the whole tutorial or article to understand this exercise, but it will dramatically improve your comprehension of this exercise's mechanics. If you want a more thorough but equally gentle introduction to the same material, consider reading (and listening to) [Taming the Terminal](https://www.bartbusschots.ie/s/blog/taming-the-terminal/).

# Set up

In addition to your laptop or desktop computer, you will need to acquire the following tools:

* For managing the virtual machines: [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) version 6.1 or newer, sometimes written as *VBox*.
* For automatically configuring virtual machine settings: [Vagrant](https://vagrantup.com/) version 2.2.7 or newer.

Complete the [Introduction to Virtual Machine Management with Vagrant](../../../practice-labs/introduction-to-virtual-machine-management-with-vagrant/README.md) practice lab before this one if you do not yet have VirtualBox and Vagrant installed or are unfamiliar with how to use them.

Then, bring the virtual machine(s) for the lab online.

**Do this:**

1. Boot the virtual machine needed for the lab:
    ```sh
    vagrant up
    ```

Once the virtual machine is running, you can continue to the next step.

# Practice

We'll begin by ensuring you have successfully completed the [set up](#set-up) steps. This process will also introduce the fundamentals that you need to understand to complete the rest of the exercise.

### Coding from scratch

### Mirroring existing sites with `wget`

> :construction: TK-TODO

### Using a reverse proxy

There is one other popular, more modern method you can use to create your look-alike Web site that deserves a mention: using a reverse proxy. Although we won't spend too much time exploring this method, it's important to be aware that specialized reverse proxies can be used in phishing attacks because they are capable of defeating common forms of two-factor authentication (2FA) or, more accurately, two-*step* authentication (2SA). Instead of simply intercepting your user name and password, these tools intercept both your username/password pair *and* the additional, secondary one-time password sent to you via text message or generated using an authenticator app such as Google Athenticator or Authy when you try to log in.

This set of attacker tools are no more difficult to use than the ones we'll be using in this exercise, but they do often require a little bit of extra infrastructure setup, which is why we'll leave using them as an exercise to the reader. For more information on using reverse proxies to mount phishing attacks, refer to the [Reverse proxies useful for phishing attacks](#reverse-proxies-useful-for-phishing-attacks) discussion section, below. Similarly, refer to the [Insufficient defensive measures: Two-factor authentication (2FA)](#two-factor-authentication-2fa) discussion section for more information on how two-factor authentication works and why it won't stop these more sophisticated phishing attacks using specialized reverse proxy frameworks.

## Publishing phishing sites on the Web

> :construction: TK-TODO

## Receiving POST-backs from lured users

> :construction: TK-TODO

## Automating the attack

> :construction: TK-TODO - This needs to be fleshed out a bit more but, for now, the basic process is:

Site cloning is a form of credential harvesting:

1. Launch the Social Engineer's Toolkit:
    ```sh
    sudo ./setoolkit
    ```
1. Choose the "Social-Engineering Attacks" item from the main menu, option number `1`.
1. Choose the "Website Attack Vectors" item from the submenu, option number `2`.
1. Choose the "Credential Harvester Attack Method" item from the submenu, option number `3`.
1. Choose the "Site Cloner" method, option number `2`.
1. Enter the IP address of the cloned Web form's HTTP POST location (the form's `action` attribute value). This should be the public IP address of your server. (Choose the automatically detected IP address by pressing `Enter`.)
1. Enter the URL of the site to clone. For example, `https://www.facebook.com/`

## Implementing additional defensive measures

> :construction: TK-TODO

### Be careful where you click

> :construction: TK-TODO

### Harden log in

> :construction: TK-TODO

#### Use a password manager

> :construction: TK-TODO

#### Use a hardware U2F-conformant security key

> :construction: TK-TODO
>
> Much like a password manager, the U2F standard programmatically checks the domain of the destination server. It also authenticates using public-key crypto instead of a password, but just programmatically checking the origin server is enough to prove the point to most users.
>
> Note that, like a password manager, this *practically* reduces the possibility of phishing attacks succeeding, but it is not immune from cases where the following conditions are all true:
>
> * attackers have stolen the site's U2F private keys for a given user.
> * DNS spoofing is in effect.
>
> Then again, if all the above conditions are all true, the site probably already has a much bigger problem than being having its users phished. :\
>
> For this reason, U2F hardware tokens are considered the strongest defense against phishing. Unfortunately, due to the cost and complexity of implementing this scheme, it is not typically available to organizations of smaller size or shallower pockets. For them, e.g., non-profits running single-server WordPress-powered sites, the recommendation is to adopt SQRL, which is free and easy.

#### Use Secure Quick Reliable Login (SQRL)

> :construction: TK-TODO
>
> In brief, the Secure Quick Reliable Login (SQRL) is a relatively new mechanism that completely replaces username/password pairs with public-key cryptography for Web site login much in the same way that sysadmins have been using for decades with, e.g., passwordless login to SSH servers using SSH keys. In this system, the domain name of the origin server is part of the mathematics that derive the user's public-facing identity, which means that look-alike web sites will be presented with a different identity than the authentic (innocent) Web site.
>
> Note that, like a password manager and the U2F case, SQRL *practically* reduces the possibility of phishing attacks succeeding, but it is not immune from cases where the following conditions are all true:
>
> * DNS spoofing is in effect; this is required in order for the SQRL client to generate the correct site-specific identity to login with. Anything short of an identical domain name match will result in a failed login.
> * Both the SQRL login agent and the login initiator (Web browser) share the same public IP address from the perspective of the targeted (innocent) Web site, such as if both the victim and attacker are located behind the same NAT router (e.g., Wi-Fi cafe) and the website being logged in to is on the public Internet. In this situation, SQRL's same IP address check is satisfied.
> * SQRL's Client-Provided Session (CPS) is being actively intercepted. This requires the attacker to be in a privileged network position (i.e., to be an on-path attacker), such as by being the ISP itself or by performing ARP cache poisoning or another form of active traffic manipulation that redirects the victim's traffic through to the website via the attacker.
>
> While there are ways to arrange for this situation to occur, it is a *significantly* higher bar for an attacker to clear. Thanks to that, coupled with the ease with which SQRL can be implemented by extremely under-resourced organizations along with its strong identity protection guarantees (i.e., doing away with usernames and password pairs completely), we consider it a worthwhile anti-phishing investment.
>
> For more details, see [How SQRL Can Thwart Phishing Attacks](https://www.grc.com/sqrl/phishing.htm). Useful SQRL resources:
>
> * [SQRL Login plugin for WordPress plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/sqrl-login/)
> * [Secure QR Login module for Drupal 8.x and 9.x](https://www.drupal.org/project/sqrl)

### Validate endpoint and message authenticity

> :construction: TK-TODO
>
> This category of phishing mitigations strengthening the identity guarantees of the person or website with which you are communicating. Note, importantly, that an authentic message can still be a phishing message if the sender's identity has been compromised. However, as this presents a much higher bar for an attacker to clear, and makes mass-phishing campaigns far less feasible, authenticating the source of your messages is a great way to dramatically reduce the liklihood both of being caught by an opportunitistically-motivated attacker as well as increasing the liklihood of noticing that something is amiss in the first place when reading messages you receive.
>
> Chief among these are TLS certificate checking, mentioned earlier, but there are additional identity verification methods you should know about and use to protect yourself and your team from phishing attacks.

#### Enable HTTPS Everywhere's "EASE mode"

> :construction: TK-TODO
>
> The [HTTPS Everywhere](https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere) add-on's "Encrypt All Sites Eligible" (EASE) mode in the HTTPS Everywhere user interface. This helps mitigate "[Client Domain Hooking](https://blog.duszynski.eu/client-domain-hooking-in-practice/)" by helping the user prevent *all* Web requests that are not secured with TLS. It only takes one non-HTTPS (HTTP-only) request to redirect a victim browser for the remainder of their browsing session.

#### Use Signal and verify your contact's Safety Numbers

> :construction: TK-TODO

#### Require email be signed with PGP keys or S/MIME certificates

> :construction: TK-TODO
>
> For example, use the [WP PGP Encrypted Emails plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-pgp-encrypted-emails/) for your WordPress site to ensure that automated email sent by your Web site can be provably authenticated as the source of the email you receive claiming to be from your Web site. This makes it possible to authenticate "password reset" emails and other critical communications.

## Leveraging current events in phishing bait

> :construction: TK-TODO

## Spear-phishing

> :construction: TK-TODO

## Reverse proxies useful for phishing attacks

> :construction: TK-TODO
>
> Quick mentions of [Evilginx2](https://github.com/kgretzky/evilginx2), [Modlishka](https://github.com/drk1wi/Modlishka), etc. These are reverse proxies that do not require phishing pages to be crafted as look-alike sites through mirroring, site cloning, or manual editing. Rather, they act as application-level ("layer 7") shims that translate domain names, DNS queries, and more originally destined to the original site into requests for resources at the fraudulent phishing domain.

Some notes for Evilginx setup follow.

Defender setup:

1. Set the defender's DNS server to include the IP address of the attacker.
    1. In `/etc/systemd/resolve.conf`, find the `DNS=` line and append the attacker's IP address.
    1. Restart the `systemd-resolved` service:
        ```sh
        sudo systemctl restart systemd-resolved.service
        ```
1. Remember, Evilginx won't respond to HTTP queries until its phishlets and lures are properly configured, enabled, and not hidden.
1. To use the graphical Firefox Web browser, make sure X11 is available over the SSH connection:
    ```sh
    vagrant ssh blue -- -X
    ```

Attacker setup:

1. Launch Evilginx in developer mode so TLS certificates are self-signed rather than requested from the Let's Encrypt CA:
    ```sh
    sudo evilginx -developer
    ```

## Two-step authentication (2SA) versus two-factor authentication (2FA)

Logging in to a service such as one offered by a Web site is important because it allows the service to identify and recognize you as distinct from someone else who also uses the service. Being able to identify one user from another is part of what makes privacy possible. Imagine a webmail provider that showed everyone who used it the same inbox because there was no difference between a logged in ("authenticated") user and logged out ("unauthenticated") one!

So *authentication* is the process of logging in, such as supplying a username and password to a login form. An authentication *factor*, however, describes what it is you use to prove your identity to the service, and thus authenticate yourself to it. There are three different authentication factors that a service might ask for:

* Something you know. Assuming that you and the service share a secret, then for as long as no other users learn this secret, your knowledge of it can provide evidence that you are who you say you are. The most common form of "something you know" authentication factor is a password.
* Something you have. Assuming that there is only one object in the world with a certain characteristic, then if you can show evidence that you have this object in your posession, the service can be confident that you are who you say you are. Common examples of a "something you have" authentication factor is a hardware security key, personalized ID badge, and so on.
* Something you are. Assuming that it remains difficult for others to replicate details about your physical body, such as your genome, iris, physical fingerprints, gait, voiceprint, and so on, then checking for these biometrics can provide evidence that you are, well, you. Note that not all biometrics are equally strong, and emerging technology such as deepfakes makes it possible to more perfectly generate audio that matches someone else's voice.

Most authentication schemes today use only one of these three factors when asking for you to prove your identity as you're logging in. As you know, most only ever ask for a password. But it's possible for a given authentication system to be designed in such a way that it would require more than one of these factors to be satisfied before a login attempt is validated. Perhaps the system asks you for a password *and* asks you to press a button on your hardware security key while it is plugged into your laptop. Such systems are called two- or multi-factor authentication systems, or 2FA or MFA for short. Even more security-conscious systems can choose to require all three factors.

An authentication factor, however, should not be confused with an authentication *step*. Where an authentication factor describes the kind of evidence you're providing to prove your identity, an authentication step is simply a discrete act of providing some authenticating information of any kind. Password screens common on the Web are frequently one-factor *and* one-step authentication systems. Most 2FA login systems are two-factor and two-step systems; the first step is a password (the first factor) and the second step is the hardware security key (the second factor).

But there are also many Web sites that offer two-step, one-factor authentication login systems. A common example is a one-time use login code such as those provided via SMS text message, or a Time-based One Time Password (TOTP) based authenticator app like Google Authenticator or Authy. While these two-step systems do raise the bar for attackers, there is nothing inherent in two-step authentication (2SA) that addresses phishing in the first place.

Automated phishing tools like [Modlishka](https://github.com/drk1wi/Modlishka) and [Evilginx](https://github.com/kgretzky/evilginx2) simply intercept the one-time password as the user enters it, same as they do with the user's own password. This is possible precisely because both the first step and the second step of the authentication process use the same factor, something you know, whether it be a password, or a one-time code, rather than two true factors. Nevertheless, such systems are often marketed as or reported to incorrectly be two-factor logins. See, for example [Google: Phishing Attacks That Can Beat Two-Factor Are on the Rise](https://www.pcmag.com/news/google-phishing-attacks-that-can-beat-two-factor-are-on-the-rise).

## Web server security headers

> :construction: TK-TODO
>
> In brief, HSTS, CSP, and CORS headers are all insufficient because:
>
> * HSTS simply demands that the site be visited over HTTPS instead of HTTP. Any phishing site that is served over HTTPS with a trusted TLS certificate will satisfy HSTS requirements.
> * CSP controls the type of content that the browser is permitted to run, but if a victim has navigated to a phishing domain, the attacker's CSP headers are the ones being seen, not the origin server's.
> * CORS controls what resources are permitted to be shared across origins but, as with CSP, this is in the attacker's control if a victim has already been lured to a phishing domain.
