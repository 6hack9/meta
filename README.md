# Anarcho-Tech NYC Collective / Tech Antifa

Shared assets for various Anarcho-Tech NYC projects live here. This is also the container for numerous projects intended to support the collective's longer-term goals. For example, our [Train the Trainers](train-the-trainers/) project is a collection of workshops and practice labs intended to support the educational efforts of digital security trainers and their students.

The easiest way to obtain the materials herein is to [download the latest copy of our work as a ZIP archive](https://github.com/AnarchoTechNYC/meta/archive/master.zip). Once downloaded, unzip the file, which can usually be accomplished simply by double-clicking on it. Once you have the files saved on your computer, you can navigate through the folders to find the project or workshop that interests you.

# Repository structure

This repository is (generally) organized in the following way:

* *`<project name>/`* folder for a given [meta-organizing project](https://github.com/AnarchoTechNYC/meta/projects).
    * `README.md` file describing the project goals, details, specific structure (if deviating from this general structure).
    * *`<subproject name>/`* folder housing files related to a particular subproject.
        * `README.md` file describing the subproject itself.

Some projects are included as [Git submodules](https://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Tools-Submodules), so use [`git clone --recursive`](http://explainshell.com/explain?cmd=git+clone+--recursive) when cloning if you'd like to obtain the entire collection.
